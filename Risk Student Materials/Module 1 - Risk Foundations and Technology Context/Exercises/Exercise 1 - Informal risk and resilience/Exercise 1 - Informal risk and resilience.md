# Exercise 1: Risk and Resilience Thinking

Risk and resilience based thinking is not a matter of following rules or procedures, but is a mindset. A mindset is characterized by a way of looking at a situation and how observations are interpreted.

## Part 1: Risk and Resilience Planning

This first exercise is a mindset exercise.  

For context, consider the 1998 Ice Storm that paralyzed parts of eastern Canada and the north-east United States.

## Part 2: Scenarios

For this section, identify an event of situation from your life where you would benefit from doing risk and resilience planning

Some ideas:
